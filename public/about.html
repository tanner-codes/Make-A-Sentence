    <h1>About and how to play!</h1>
        <h3 style=" color: white; text-align: center;">This Make a Sentence game is a fun and interactive multiplayer experience where players collaborate to create a funny sentence, one word at a time. The objective is to build a hilarious and goofy sentence by taking turns adding words. Players join a game room, either by creating a new game or joining an existing one. Once in the game, the first player starts by entering a word, and the turn then passes to the next player. Each player contributes a word, building upon the previous words to form a sentence. The game continues until a player submits a word that completes the sentence with a ., !, or ? at the end of that word. Players can also engage in a chat feature to communicate and talk with their fellow players. The game encourages creativity and a playful approach to language. </h3>
